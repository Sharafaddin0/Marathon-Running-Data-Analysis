# Marathon-Running-Data-Analysis
This project is EDA of a huge dataset which contains tables, graphs and solutions to some problems.

Il set di dati specificato scaricato da: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/data

About the dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data in this file is a large collection of ultra-marathon race records (7 million) registered between 1798 and 2022 (a period of well over two centuries). 
The following columns (with data types) are included in this dataset:

    Year of event (int64)
    Event dates (object)
    Event name (object)
    Event distance/length (object)
    Event number of finishers (int64)
    Athlete performance (object)
    Athlete club (object)
    Athlete country (object)
    Athlete year of birth (float64)
    Athlete gender (object)
    Athlete age category (object)
    Athlete average speed (object)
    Athlete ID (int64)

In this project, I have done multiple stages of Data Analysis like Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation etc. 
Here, I created several charts and graphs to visualize key insights from the dataset. These include:

  Histograms to understand the distribution of athlete speeds across different race lengths.
  Violin plots to compare the distribution of race performance across different age groups and genders.
  Scatter plots with regression lines to analyze the relationship between athlete age and average speed.
  Box plots to detect outliers and understand the spread of race results.

Questions to solve
1. Difference for the average speed of athletes for the 50km and 50 miles for both gender
2. TOP 10 best age groups on the 50 miles race
3. TOP 5 worst age groups on the 50 miles race
4. Are athletes are slower in summer rather than winter?

Thank you for attention!!!!!!!!!!!
